    "answer": "As a visitor to Canada on a tourist visa, you are generally not allowed to work in the country. However, there are some exceptions. If you have a temporary resident permit valid for 6 months or more, are waiting on a decision for permanent residence, have refugee status, or fall under specific agreements like CUSMA, you may be allowed to work without a work permit. It's important to note that visitors are not eligible to apply for a work permit from inside Canada. If you are eligible, you can apply for a work permit before traveling to Canada or at a port of entry if you meet certain requirements.",
